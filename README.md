# MLS-Scrapers
Scrapes MLS data

mlssoccer_scrape.py is written with Python 2.7.  It asks users for a year, then scrapes roster data from the tables in the boxscore
and returns a csv file appropriately named with the year.  For example, if the user entered 2014, the csv file generated would be called
"mls2014.csv".

It will only work for years that still list boxscores.
